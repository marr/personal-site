Code allows us to create objects that begin as ideas. My curiousity around code started as a kid, constructing programs from recipes found in guides produced by Atari and Radio Shack – two names that might require some digging to find information on today. [ancient texts](http://www.atarimania.com/documents-atari-400-800-xl-xe-manuals_2_8.html)

These programming sessions consumed hours of my time and had memorably disappointing results. Fast-forward thirty-five years, I remain curious, and now make a living off the activity that intrigued me as a child. "Crushing code" means following these paths of interest while at the same time understanding there is [always more to know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

Today, my time is spent trying to work smarter and focus on technologies that feel like they optimize the time between getting started and being productive. Some tools that have recently come into favor include:

- [Remix](https://remix.run/) – Modern approach to building applications that embraces web fundamentals. 
- [Stately](https://stately.ai/) – Visual modeling for application state logic. 
- [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) – Library for building state machines.

This site is built with Remix - go read their documentation now if you haven't already. The back-end and front-end are much simpler to reason about with this new framework. If your goal is to keep the web great and restore forgotten dreams like progressive enhancement, do check out Remix. Their discord is quite active and full of people with new perspectives on building durable web applications. I expect this will be the next "react" or "node" kind of technology - one that will be around and only increase in activity for the next dozen years.

Stately and Xstate are also tech worth exploring. State machines are not a new concept, but the tooling up until now has left much to be desired. When your team is running in circles trying to establish how their user flow should behave, you can create a bulletproof model in minutes.
