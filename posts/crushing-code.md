Code allows us to create objects that begin as ideas. My curiousity around code started as a kid, constructing programs from [ancient texts](http://www.atarimania.com/documents-atari-400-800-xl-xe-manuals_2_8.html) produced by Atari and Radio Shack – two names that might require some digging to find information on today. 

These programming sessions consumed hours of my time and had memorably disappointing results. Fast-forward thirty-five years, I remain curious, and now make a living off the activity that intrigued me as a child. _Crushing code_ means following these paths of interest while at the same time understanding there is [always more to know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

Today, my time is spent trying to work smarter and focus on technologies that optimize the time between getting started and being productive. Some tools that I have recently added to my arsenal include:

- [Remix](https://remix.run/) – Modern approach to building applications that embraces web fundamentals. 
- [Stately](https://stately.ai/) – Visual modeling for application state logic. 
- [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) – Library for building state machines.

This site is built with Remix. The back-end and front-end are much simpler to reason about with this new framework. If your goal is to keep the web great and restore forgotten dreams like progressive enhancement, do check out Remix.

Their discord is quite active and full of people with new perspectives on building durable web applications. I believe Remix will have a similar reception to React or Node in terms of de-facto standards. It will be around for a long time, and only increase in activity over the next dozen years. You can count on it!

Stately and Xstate are also tech worth exploring. State machines are not a new
concept, but the tooling up until now has left much to be desired. When your
team is running in circles trying to define their user flow, you could create a bulletproof model in minutes.

To familiarize yourself with Xstate, [check out this demo of the author walking through a video player example](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/modeling-application/1).
