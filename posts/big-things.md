# Writing is fun(damental) ðŸ¤ª

After reading Paul Graham's essay on different types of procrastination and how they can be beneficial, I think my "big" focus should be on writing. The [article explains](http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html) that you can be distracted by errands quite easily, while the important work goes undone.

This hit home for me, since I find general computing to be "errand-like" as it's usually done in small pieces. Updating your OS, keeping up-to-date with git branching strategies, answering questions on discord. Lots of things that are enjoyable but take time away from your "Magnum Opus" as Paul calls it. He posits about working on things that you will be remembered for, and postponing tasks that can be done later, even if it will make them more difficult. This nets a "positive" effort, since the big things are more important, and focusing on them above all else is what really matters.
