> Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.
>
> ~ Paul Graham

After reading Paul Graham's [essay on different types of procrastination](http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html) and how they can be beneficial, I now believe my main focus should be on writing. The article explains that you can be distracted by errands quite easily, while the important work goes undone. When words flow onto the page, your mind is freed up to think about other things. Therefore, prioritizing writing for me will inevitably lead towards more productive thinking.

General computing tasks feel like errands, as they are usually done in small pieces. Things like updating your operating system, answering questions on discord, and filtering emails. They are sometimes enjoyable and always delaying work on your life's Great Work, or "Magnum Opus", as Paul calls it. Why spend time on tasks that you can postpone, when you can focus on things that you will be remembered for instead? Even if those delayed tasks are made more difficult due to reasons like falling behind on laundry, or cutting your hair, it still nets a positive effort to put them off because the big things are more important, and focusing on those above all else is what really matters.

This made me immediately think: _it would be nice to look back and have some type of professional timeline on record._ Hence, this article. I still plan to maintain my home and health, but for now sharing my personal productivity tips and technical know-how regularly will be a priority. Imagine looking back thirty years from now and having a volume of work that was instrumental to your success. Someone once told me, "Stack good days on good days", and writing is proof that you have accomplished that goal.
